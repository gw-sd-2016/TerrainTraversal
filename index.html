							A robust method of terrain traversal in autonomous robots is crucial to applications such as disaster response, navigation in alien landscapes (ex. surface of the moon, Mars, etc.), and creating humanoid robots.  Current research towards creating autonomous robots that are able to traverse a variety of terrains focuses on physically robust algorithms governing the kinematics of the robot. This approach towards robot movement uses brute force, requiring motion algorithms to be able to accommodate an incredibly broad range of worst case scenarios. Not only is this illogical for pathway traversal in new landscapes such as those in space and those in disaster zones, but it is also unlikely that the humanoid robots we hope to interact with would move in such a fashion.
					<p>
							My project aims to show that, given an environment with a variety of terrains and a starting and end point, elucidating best paths for traversal based on terrain type will increase the ease of robotic traversal by avoiding the kinematic problems faced by rough terrains.
							Using computer vision algorithms and new depth imaging technology, my project will identify different terrain sections, classify terrain types, and rank terrain sections based on the ease of mobility in the terrain for a multi-legged robot. By mounting a tablet with depth imaging capabilities to be front-facing on a multi-legged robot, I will use images from the forward path to calculate the best traversal path for the robot based on an understanding of the different terrains that paths would cross to choose a final path that is easier to navigate.
					<p>
							This approach will be tested against methods of traversal that only involve kinematics for a qualitative analysis of the improvements gained from adding terrain understanding to terrain traversal. In addition to improved paths for the robot’s navigation, this project will yield an iOS application that will display a visualization of the terrain segmentation and ranking algorithm to visualize the algorithm’s classification and ranking to researchers involved in the project.
